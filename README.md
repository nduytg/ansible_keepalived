Ansible Keepalived
=========

I have looked around at available keepalived roles on Github but none meet my expectation, so I create my own role here. 

`Priority`, `Weight` will be automatically caculated based on `number of nodes, VIPs` and `internal_priority` settings. You only need to change all your variables in `vars/main.yml`. Try it and have fun^^.

PRs are welcomed
